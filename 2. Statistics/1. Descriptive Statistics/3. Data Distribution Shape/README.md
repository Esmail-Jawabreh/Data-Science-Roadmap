# Data Distribution Shape

The shape of a data distribution provides insight into how values are spread and whether they deviate from the normal distribution.  
This section focuses on two key measures: **Skewness** and **Kurtosis**.

## Topics Covered in the PDF
- **Skewness** — Measures asymmetry of the distribution.  
  - Symmetric (Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode)  
  - Positively skewed (Mean > Median > Mode)  
  - Negatively skewed (Mean < Median < Mode)  
- **Kurtosis** — Measures peakedness or "tailedness" of the distribution.  
  - Mesokurtic (Normal, ≈ 3)  
  - Leptokurtic (Heavy tails, > 3)  
  - Platykurtic (Flat, < 3)  
- **Comparison Table** — Summary of properties of skewness vs kurtosis.  
- **Visual Examples** — Diagrams showing symmetric, skewed, and different kurtosis distributions.

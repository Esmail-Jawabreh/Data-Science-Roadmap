# Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of Central Tendency are statistical metrics used to determine the center or "typical" value of a dataset.  
They help summarize data into a single representative value, making it easier to understand overall characteristics.

## Topics Covered in the PDF
- **Mean** — Arithmetic average of the dataset.
- **Median** — Middle value when the data is ordered.
- **Mode** — Most frequently occurring value.
- **Comparison** between mean, median, and mode.
- **Common mistakes** to avoid when using these measures.
- **Visual examples** showing positions of each measure in different distributions.

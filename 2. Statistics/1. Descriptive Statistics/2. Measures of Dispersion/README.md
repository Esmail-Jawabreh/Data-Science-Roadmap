# Measures of Dispersion

Measures of Dispersion describe the spread or variability of a dataset.  
While measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) tell us where the center is, measures of dispersion tell us **how far the data values are from that center**.

## Topics Covered in the PDF
- **Range** — Difference between the largest and smallest values.
- **Variance** — Average squared deviation from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation** — Square root of variance, same units as data.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)** — Range of the middle 50% of the data.
- **Comparison table** — Summary of properties for each measure.
- **Common mistakes** — Frequent errors when interpreting dispersion.
- **Visual examples** — Boxplots and charts showing data spread.
